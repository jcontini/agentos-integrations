instructions: |
  The Books app manages your reading library with pull/push capabilities.
  
  **Getting started:**
  1. Pull your Goodreads library: `Books(action: "pull", connector: "goodreads", path: "~/Downloads/goodreads_library_export.csv")`
  2. View your library: `Books(action: "list")` (defaults to local library)
  3. Update a book: `Books(action: "update", id: "...", rating: 5, status: "read")`
  
  **Connectors:**
  - `local` - Your local library (default for list/get/create/update/delete)
  - `goodreads` - Pull only (CSV import, no API)
  - `hardcover` - Pull and push (API)

```

### Browse Your Library

```
Books(action: "list")                           # All books (uses local library by default)
Books(action: "list", status: "read")           # Books you've read
Books(action: "list", status: "reading")        # Currently reading
Books(action: "list", rating: 4)                # 4+ star books
Books(action: "list", search: "Sanderson")      # Search by title/author
```
